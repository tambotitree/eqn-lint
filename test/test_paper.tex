\begin{abstract}
We make the outrageous claim that
\[
 E = m^{c3}
\]
and therefore all of modern physics is in error.  
By embedding our post-Newtonian, pre-Einsteinian, quasi-Hilbertian manifold in a 43-dimensional, para-compactified hyper-superspace, we derive a new expression for the vacuum permittivity in terms of the golden ratio, the fine-structure constant, and the price of shrimp in Mindanao.

\section{Introduction}
Mainstream physics has long been shackled by the tyranny of empiricism \cite{Einstein1905,Bohm1952,FakeCitation2024}.  
In this work, we liberate ourselves from such constraints by allowing dimensional analysis to roam free in an unbounded topological playground.  
We show that by replacing $c$ with $c^3$ in massâ€“energy equivalence, the anomalous Lamb shift can be explained without recourse to quantum electrodynamics, relativity, or common sense.

\section{Methodology}
Our method begins with a non-linear regression over an imaginary data set (Table~\ref{tab:imaginarydata}), constrained only by the requirement that it produce visually pleasing plots.  
We employ an LLM-augmented agent swarm \cite{Vaswani2017,SpeciousAgent2025} to generate symbolic manipulations unconstrained by training data sanity checks.  
The agents debate internally until consensus is reached, or until one of them cites a preprint that does not exist.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:outrageous}
 \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathcal{E}} = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} \left( \frac{\hbar\Phi}{\alpha^2 G_{\mathrm{shrimp}}} \right)
\end{equation}

Here $\Phi$ is the Panguil flux quantum, $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant, and $G_{\mathrm{shrimp}}$ is the gravitational constant expressed in kilograms of shrimp per square parsec.

\section{Results}
Substituting Eq.~\eqref{eq:outrageous} into the extended Bethe-Salpeter equation yields convergence after only three imaginary iterations.  
Figure~\ref{fig:unicornplot} demonstrates the resulting hyper-spectral unicorn emission spectrum.

\section{Discussion}
The presented approach complements, rather than replaces, human peer review.
Its strength lies in rapid, automated detection of mechanical inconsistencies, freeing reviewers to focus on conceptual novelty.
We discuss limitations in LLM reasoning, false positives, and mitigation strategies.
We propose that this tool can be integrated into an LLM agent chain to improve accuracy and validity, even in speculative or non-empirical research such as the present work.
